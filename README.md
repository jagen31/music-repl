# Introduction

This is an implementation of tonart which began as a #%top-interaction to help 
speed the prototyping process along.

# TODO
- Expand to comp and stop (to get lengths of subexpressions)
- Horizontal/Vertical composition
- Capture only certain patterns after assembling
- Scales
- Harmonies
- Ties
- Elisions
